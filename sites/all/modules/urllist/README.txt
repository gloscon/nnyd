DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a list of links to pages in a Drupal site for indexing by search engines.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
None

INSTALLATION
------------
See INSTALL.txt in this directory.

MORE INFORMATION
----------------
Potential future features are gz output, turning off certain node types
in the list, and the option to override specific nodes being listed.

For now, if you use this module, and want to override listing a specific
node, you could use robots.txt to make an exclusion or unpublish it.
